# React-redux
The goal of this lab is to learn how React communicate with Redux.

Understand what's the purpose of a **Container VS Component** (or PureComponent)

How we can dispatch actions, create a global store with a reducer

The usage of Redux is overkill for this context as I have only few objects to store, but it was for the learning purpose.


## Preview

User can add a random value and add it or substract it to the current counter

As the store is immutable, we can keep a history of the store (List of actions)
